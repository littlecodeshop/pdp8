OS8 Version 3Q RX01 diskette images, extracted from old RX01 diskettes
by John Wilson <wilsonj@rpi.edu> who E-mailed these images to Doug Jones
<jones@cs.uiowa.edu> on Sept 2, 1994.  These disk images were then
converted to the format documented here.

The two diskette images in this file are:

   os8boot, the core of the OS/8 distribution.
   os8f4, other OS/8 utilities, including FORTRAN.

Also included is:

   os8FORMAT, the format of the RX01 diskettes used by Jones's PDP-8 emulator.
   os8LICENCE, the licence agreement under which this material is distributed.
   os8README, this text!

Please read the licence agreement!  DEC has been very generous with this!

Both diskette images are distributed in uuencoded format.  If you have
a UNIX system, piping this distribution into sh will include the needed
calls to uudecode to undo this.  If you are extracting this archive on a
non-UNIX system, you will need to uudecode the files separately.

To check if the files uudecoded correctly, note that each file should be
exactly 256512 bytes long.

Booting OS/8 from these disks on the emulator and then using the DIRECT
command after setting the system date appropriately gives the following
output (if you don't set the date, most remains the same as is shown):

NOTE:  Johnny Billquist at Uppsala University has reported an error in the
file names assigned on the os8f4 disk; it appears that the file named
PASS20.SV should be named PASS2O.SV (the zero should be a capital O).
I believe that this disk image is a near-virgin copy of the original
distribution, so this error may have been in the original distribution and
therefore is not fixed here!  You will have to rename this file in order
to use the FORTRAN IV compiler.
