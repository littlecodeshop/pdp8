The diskette images in this file have the following format:

   Bytes 0 to 255 -- header

      bytes 0 to 3 are "rx01" -- the magic number that prevents mounting
      an rx01 format file to emulate some other kind of device.

      bytes 4 to 255 are the deleted data bits, 8*251 bits is 2008, allowing
      one bit for each of the 2002 sectors, with the 6 most significant bits
      of byte 255 unused.  The deleted data bit for track 0 sector 1 is the
      least significant bit of byte 4.  No known use is made of these bits
      on a real RX01 by any program other than the diagnostics.

   Bytes 255 to 256511

      There are 77 tracks of data, tracks 0 to 76, stored consecutively.

      Within each track, there are 26 sectors of data, sectors 1 to 26,
      stored consecutively in the order of physical sector number, making
      2002 total sectors.  No record is maintained of format-time
      interleaving of the diskette (DEC's preformatted RX01 disks were not
      interleaved at this level).  Physical sector numbers are not the same
      as the logical sector numbers seen by RX01 users under OS/8 or RT/11!

      Within each sector, there are 128 bytes, stored consecutively, making
      256256 total bytes of data.
